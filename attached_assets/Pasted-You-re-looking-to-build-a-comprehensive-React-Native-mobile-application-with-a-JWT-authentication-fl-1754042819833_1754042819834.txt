You're looking to build a comprehensive React Native mobile application with a JWT authentication flow. Let's break down the features and screens you've outlined.

App Flow and Features
Initial App Load & Permissions
When the app first loads, it will prompt the user for camera permission. This is crucial for the scanning functionality later on.

Authentication Screens
Login Screen
The Login Screen will be the entry point for returning users.

A prominent app icon will be displayed at the top.

Users will enter their Email and Password.

A toggle icon will be available to show or hide the password.

A clear Login button will submit credentials.

Links for Forget password, Not a member? Signup now, and contact us will be provided.

Forget Password Screen
This screen allows users to reset their password.

It will also feature the app icon at the top.

Users will input their Email.

A Forget password button will initiate the reset process.

A Login link will allow users to return to the login screen.

Register Screen
For new users, the Register Screen will capture necessary details.

The app icon will be present.

Fields for First name, Last name, Email, and Password will be included.

A password toggle will be available.

A register button will create the new account.

A Login link will direct users back to the login screen.

Contact Us Screen (Pre-Login)
This screen allows non-logged-in users to send messages.

It will include the app icon and a "Send a message" heading.

A dropdown for feedback type (e.g., request, suggestions) will be provided.

Fields for Email, Subject, and Message will be available.

A file upload option will be included.

A Send button will submit the message.

A Login link will direct users back to the login screen.

Header Content & Environment Configuration
All screens will feature a consistent header.

A toggle button on the left will open and close the side menu.

The header title will dynamically change to reflect the current screen (e.g., "About Us" when on the About Us screen).

A left arrow icon will be present for navigating back to the previous screen.

A hidden feature will allow access to environment settings:

Tapping a small, discreet icon (referred to as ". " in your prompt) will open a dialog.

This dialog will prompt for a password input with a toggle to show/hide it.

OK and Cancel buttons will be available.

The password will be in the format jaMMYY (e.g., ja0825 for August 2025).

If the password is correct, the app will navigate to the Env Screen.

Env Screen
This screen allows configuration of the app environment.

It will display the app icon.

A dropdown will offer options for dev, val, and prod environments.

A Back button will return the user to the Login Page.

Post-Login Screens and Functionality
Once a user successfully logs in, they will be directed to the After Login Screen.

After Login Screen (Camera Scanner)
This screen will immediately open the camera for scanning.

The header will remain consistent with the side menu toggle and a right-aligned left arrow icon (likely for navigating back from the camera view if needed).

Project Details Screen
If a valid scanner code (received via email) is scanned, the app will navigate to the Project Details Screen.

This screen will display the project name and the email associated with the scanned project.

View Icon: Tapping this will navigate to a sub-screen.

This sub-screen will have a header with a right-aligned icon to navigate back.

It will display the Project Name and Email.

A Token length label dropdown will offer options: low, medium, high.

A timer of 30 seconds will count down, after which a new 10-digit random code will be generated.

The 10-digit random code will be displayed and regenerate every 30 seconds.

Delete Icon: This will allow the user to delete a project.

A bottom + icon will navigate back to the After Login Screen (camera view) to scan another project.

Left Side Menu
The side menu, accessible via the toggle button in the header, will provide navigation to various sections.

At the top of the menu, the app logo will be displayed.

The menu options will include:

About us

About Us Screen
This screen will have the standard header.

It will display the Project name, version, and a brief description about the application.

Fields for Email, New password, and Confirm password will be present.
