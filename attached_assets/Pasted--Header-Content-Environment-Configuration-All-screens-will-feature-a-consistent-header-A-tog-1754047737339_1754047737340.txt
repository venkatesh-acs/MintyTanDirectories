
Header Content & Environment Configuration
All screens will feature a consistent header.

A toggle button on the left will open and close the side menu.

The header title will dynamically change to reflect the current screen (e.g., "About Us" when on the About Us screen).

A left arrow icon will be present for navigating back to the previous screen.

A hidden feature will allow access to environment settings:

Tapping a small, discreet icon (referred to as ". " in your prompt) will open a dialog.

This dialog will prompt for a password input with a toggle to show/hide it.

OK and Cancel buttons will be available.

The password will be in the format jaMMYY (e.g., ja0825 for August 2025).

If the password is correct, the app will navigate to the Env Screen.

This screen allows configuration of the app environment.

It will display the app icon.

This sub-screen will have a header with a right-aligned icon to navigate back.

A Token length label dropdown will offer options: low, medium, high.

A timer of 30 seconds will count down, after which a new 10-digit random code will be generated.

Delete Icon: This will allow the user to delete a project.

A bottom + icon will navigate back to the After Login Screen (camera view) to scan another project.
